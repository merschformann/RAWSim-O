# RAWSim-O

RAWSim-O is a discrete event-based simulation for Robotic Mobile Fulfillment Systems. The intention of the simulation framework is to provide a tool for researching effects of multiple decision problems that occur when running such a system. For this, the framework enables easy extensibility for implementing new decision methods for the different decision problems.

## Quick start

Open RAWSimO.sln with Visual Studio and select RAWSimO.Visualization as the project to execute. Under the "Instances" press the checkmark button to generate a default instance. Then go to the "Base Controls" tab and press the play button. Depending on the instance size and simulation settings instance generation and simulation initialization may take longer.

## Controller implementation quick start

In the following video you can find a very short tutorial for implementing your own controller logic: https://youtu.be/ClN7NZL930w
